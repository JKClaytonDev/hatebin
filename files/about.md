## What is this pastedown thing?

Pastedown is an [open-source](https://github.com/cespare/pastedown), self-hosted pastebin server. It is meant
to handle [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) well, but it also works with code
snippets (and does syntax highlighting).

This page is itself a file stored in pastedown. Click 'edit' to see the unrendered source text.
