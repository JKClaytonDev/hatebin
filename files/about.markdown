## What is this?

Pastedown is an [open-source](https://github.com/cespare/pastedown), self-hosted pastebin server. It is meant to handle [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) well, but it also works with code snippets (and does syntax highlighting).

This page is itself a file stored in pastedown. Click 'edit' to see the unrendered source text.

See the [markdown reference](/#reference.markdown) to see what markdown syntax and features are supported.

Pastedown is meant to be used in situations where you want to share information among a group of people but not the world at large. To this end:

* It is self-hosted.
* All documents are completely deleted from the server some (configurable) amount of time after creation.
* There is no way to get a list of documents stored in Pastedown -- you must have the id to access them.

If you're looking for a general-purpose pastebin or markdown renderer, try out some of these:

* [Gist](https://gist.github.com/)
* [Pastie.org](http://pastie.org/)
* [Gist.io](http://gist.io/)
* [Socrates.io](http://socrates.io)

Enjoy :P
