The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those
generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of

distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to
kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

The surface is fine and powdery. I can kick it up loosely with my toe. It does adhere in fine layers, like
powdered charcoal, to the `sole` and sides of my boots. I only go in a `small` fraction of an inch, maybe an

seems to be no difficult in moving around, as we suspected.
